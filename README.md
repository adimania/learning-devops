Learning DevOps
=======


By definition, DevOps is a cultural movement to call for better collaboration and thinking between software developers and operations folks. 

This book is the consolidation of our experiences in managing infrastructure of various scales, from a few servers to a few thousands. In the book, we discuss about how to implement the DevOps practices in an organization and how to improve existing practices. More than anything else, DevOps is a mind set. With right guidance and tools, embracing DevOps principles can help teams achieve better productivity. This ultimately helps organizations to have better, robust products for their customers. End result is happy technical folks, happy managers, happy organizations and happy customers.

The material is designed to be concise. It should not be used as a reference book, but as a refresher book or in an instructor led program.
