Managing code can be difficult. Often, we work on multiple projects, due to which we need to maintain several code bases on our machines. We may also need to work on more than one feature on same code base. We would frequently collaborate with our colleagues on certain features as well. There would be cases where we might be needed to revert our code to an older time due to performance issues or code bugs.
A good version control system will handle all these cases for us. Some of the well known version control systems are:

* Git
* Subversion
* Mercurial

We will have a look at Git which is the most popular version control system out there.
