#What is DevOps?
The term, "DevOps" was coined in 2008 and was discussed widely in European technical conferences.  The American techies caught up and immediately liked the idea. More discussion followed up and eventually DevOps was born as it is now.

So, what was this ground breaking idea?

The idea was that there is a need of better communication and collaboration between developers and operations. Eventually, the idea evolved and now a days it is very common to have cross teams which consists of develops, systems engineers, product managers, designers and so on. 

## How does DevOps helps?
In traditional development houses, the teams are often secluded in silos. Usually, at least the following teams exist:
* Product
* Development
* Quality Assurance
* Systems Engineering or Operations

Let us consider a typical scenario where product team came up with a brilliant idea which will make the customers happy and will get the organization lots of money. Now, they will pass on the product details to the development and development team will get on it. They will put in all the efforts they can and build the amazing product. Using latest Ruby to build the application will help plug a lot of security holes. While running Rails on Passenger will help in improving the speed of processing the requests. They have got all the tools which will get the vision of product team out as soon as possible in a very nice way. After weeks or months of hard work, the great product will be ready.

QA teams will step in at this point. But since they are walking into the fun a little late, it will be difficult for them to test easily. Scores of emails and spec sheets about the features will be passed on to and fro from both QA team and development team. Several cases and potential bugs could be missed and several will be discovered late. After a number of long iterations, QA team will sign off the product for deployment.

While development teams are having team outing to celebrate a product greatly done, ops team look and it and squint in dismay. Well, they don't support this version of Ruby. They also have enterprise support for that other application server, and not Passenger. To run Passenger, they will have to jump through additional hoops at organization's procurement department. And no one told them what all data they need to backup and how much traffic they should expect.  

The team outing is ruined. Of course, none of the product teams, development teams and the organization management is happy. Customers won't get the great product or feature on time.
